# Seattle-Weather Project: Comparing Rainfall in Seattle and New York ( 2020-2024) 
This repository will store information about Seattle Weather from data provided within the course.
The Seattle Weather project will look into weather trends in Seattle and whether it rains more in Seattle or New York.
This project will help us learn skills such as data cleaning and visualization. 
# Data 
This data is from NOAA ( National Oceanic Atmospheric Association) and measures rain data from January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2024
The NOAA Climate Data can be found here https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND 
# Data Preparation 
This notebook contain various steps taken to prepare and clean the NOAA rainfall data from New York and Seattle. Some steps taken include filtering for only precipitation data, removing duplicates & null values, joining the data sets, and renaming column and tidying up our data. The notebook with all these steps is: Sienna_Martinez_Seattle_Weather_Data_Preparation.ipynb and the final clean csv file of the data is: SM_clean_seattle_nyc_weather.csv 
# Data Analysis
The analysis of this data contains numerous plots such as line graphs, histograms, and a heatmap to show the comparison between precipitation levels from 2020-2023 by city, month, season, and year. This analysis included coding for a precipitation average and extracting year and month values from the original dataset and can be found as: Sienna_Martinez_DATA 3320_Seattle_NYC_Analysis_Template.ipynb
